  <h1>Vayigash 2025: Making Way for the Image of God</h1>
  <p class="meta"><em>Musings</em></p>
</header>

<main>

  <p>
    At the heart of the Torah stands a single, demanding claim:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Love your neighbor as yourself.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This is not a marginal ethic. It is the axis on which Jewish moral life turns. The rabbis insist on it. And so does
    Yeshua, who presses this command to its furthest, most uncomfortable edge:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Love not only your neighbor, but even your enemy. Pray for those who persecute you.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This is not a departure from Torah. It is a radical unveiling of what Torah has always required.
  </p>

  <h2>The Torah Begins with Adam—for a Reason</h2>

  <p>
    The Jerusalem Talmud (Yerushalmi Nedarim 9:4) teaches that human dignity (<em>kavod ha-briyyot</em>) is so weighty
    that it can override even rabbinic prohibitions. Why? Because to shame a person is to shame the image of God.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rabbi Ben Azzai makes the logic explicit:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The Torah begins with Adam, not Abraham, to teach that every human being—before covenant, nation, or merit—is
      created <em>b’tzelem Elohim</em>, in the image of God.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This is the foundation of Jewish ethics. Before there is law, there is dignity.
  </p>

  <h2>Kings, Queens, and a Subversive Torah</h2>

  <p>
    In the ancient Near East, only kings were said to bear the image of the gods. Their divine likeness justified their
    power and their duty: to protect the poor, the widow, and the vulnerable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Genesis quietly overturns this worldview.
  </p>

  <p>
    It declares that all human beings are created in God’s image. Which means:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We are all kings and queens.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Not sovereign rulers, but servant-kings, ruling under Hashem, responsible for creation and for one another. Authority
    becomes obligation. Power becomes care.
  </p>

  <h2>Idolatry Reconsidered</h2>

  <p>
    Abraham Joshua Heschel sharpens the point:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Torah forbids idolatry not because God cannot be imaged—but because God already has one. The human being.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To demean a person is not merely unethical; it is idolatrous.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Idolatry is not only a sin against God. It is a sin against other people.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This applies universally:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the poor</li>
    <li>the immigrant</li>
    <li>LGBTQ+ people</li>
    <li>antisemites</li>
    <li>those we disagree with or fear</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Liking someone is not the criterion. Agreement is irrelevant.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Image precedes judgment.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>The Greatest Commandment, Re-seen</h2>

  <p>
    When Yeshua summarizes the Torah, he does not innovate. He clarifies.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Love God with all your heart (the Shema).</li>
    <li>Love your neighbor as yourself.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These are not two commands. They are two sides of the same reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    The two tablets of the Torah reflect this structure:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>honor God;</li>
    <li>honor human beings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To violate one is to fracture the other.
  </p>

  <h2>“Make Way for the Image of God”</h2>

  <p>
    A striking rabbinic image appears in Devarim Rabbah 4:4: angels are said to walk before each person, proclaiming,
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Make way for the image of God.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The imagery echoes ancient idol processions—but with a stunning reversal.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The idol is not carried. The idol walks.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Imagine living this way. Imagine each encounter framed by reverence rather than reaction.
  </p>

  <h2>The Image as a Shadow</h2>

  <p>
    There is one more layer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Hebrew word <em>tzelem</em> (image) is linguistically bound to <em>tzel</em>—shadow.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A shadow cannot exist without proximity to its source.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We cannot reflect God’s presence in the world unless we walk closely with God. Minute by minute. Day by day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethics without intimacy collapses into abstraction. Spiritual closeness is what allows us to recognize the image of God
    in others—especially when it is obscured.
  </p>

  <h2>Torah, Haftarah, Besorah—One Moral Arc</h2>

  <p><strong>Torah: Vayigash</strong></p>
  <p>
    Judah steps forward. Joseph reveals himself. A fractured family is reunited. The story turns on responsibility,
    self-offering, and reconciliation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Haftarah: Ezekiel 37:15–28</strong></p>
  <p>
    Two sticks—Judah and Joseph—are joined into one. Division yields to unity. Estrangement yields to peace.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Besorah: Matthew 5:27–48</strong></p>
  <p>
    The moral demand moves inward:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>from action to intention</li>
    <li>from legality to faithfulness</li>
    <li>from retaliation to love</li>
    <li>from tribal loyalty to universal compassion</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    “Be perfect,” not flawless—but whole, undivided, integrated in love.
  </p>

  <h2>Where Jewish Ethics Begin</h2>

  <p>
    Shai Held writes:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In a world where God often feels absent, the human being becomes a kind of substitute presence. God is made present
      through us.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Jewish ethics does not begin with rules. It begins with recognition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each and every human being is a kind of theophany—a visible revelation of God. If we truly believed that, we would
    make way. Every time.
